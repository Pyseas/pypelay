# Installation

## Orcaflex version
*pypelay* is compatible with Orcaflex version 11.5a and above. It will not work
correctly with earlier Orcaflex versions.

## Python environment
*pypelay* is run using Python, and so requires a working Python environment.

VS Code is the recommended IDE for running Python. A tutorial for getting started
with Python in VS Code is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

It is recommended to follow all steps in the tutorial, including creating a virtual environment.

## pypelay package
The *pypelay* package is distributed as a *whl* file which is installed into the Python
environment using pip. Ensure that the virtual environment is activated, for example:

```
(.venv) C:\Users\totoro\my_project>pip install pypelay-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
