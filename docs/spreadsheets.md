# Spreadsheets

## Input spreadsheets

### options.xlsx
Options related to pipe segmentation and deadband.

### environment.xlsx
Wave and current data required for dynamic analysis.

#### Sheet: hs_dirn
Dynamic analysis will be run for each Hs and Direction combination.
For example 2x Hs and 3x Directions will create 6x combinations.

| Column        | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| hs            | List of Hs values (m)     |
| dirn          | List of directions (deg)  |
| dirn_name     | Name used for grouping results, e.g. 60, 90 and 120 can be named 'beam' |

#### Sheet: current

#### Sheet: wave_search
Input data required by the [wave_search][pypelay.wave_search] function:

| Column        | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| tp            | Wave peak period (s)      |
| gamma         | JONSWAP peakedness parameter |
| hmax_factor   | Hmax = hmax_factor * Hs   |
| h_tol         | Hmax tolerance (m)       |
| thmax_target  | Target period of Hmax    |
| t_tol         | thmax tolerance (s)      |
| before        | Number of seconds in dynamic simulation before peak wave occurs |
| after         | Number of seconds in dynamic simulation after peak wave occurs |
| numseed       | Number of wave seeds to find |

#### Sheet: waves
This sheet is automatically created when the user runs the [wave_search][pypelay.wave_search] function.

## Output spreadsheets

### static_results.xlsx


### results.xlsx
This spreadsheet is generated by [run_sims][pypelay.run_sims] after all
dynamic simulations are complete. It contains all results, one row for
each simulation.

### dyn_summary.xlsx
